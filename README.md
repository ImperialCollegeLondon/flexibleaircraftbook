# Software repository for Dynamics of Flexible Aircraft (CUP, 2023)
Here you can find the scripts used in the book [Dynamics of Flexible Aircraft](https://www.cambridge.org/9781108420600) by Palacios and Cesnik.
Each folder correspond to a chapter in the book. The name of the script to launch the simulation can be found in the book under the relevant figures.

The *.m scripts should run on any recent version of matlab. They have been last checked in Matlab R2022b.

The python notebooks need however first to install [SHARPy](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeroelastics/sharpy) in your system. They have been last checked for SHARPy v2.0.

We welcome contributions. if you can think of an improvement to the scripts, feel free to start a pull request.
